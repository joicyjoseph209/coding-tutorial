#Q. The search engine company wants to run a task to capture the count of current query records based on the provided user_id (e.g id = 1).
#Create the store procedure for the same.(means based on the user_id we should be able to determine the count of queries he/she searched for)

#Stored procedure with IN-OUT parameter
