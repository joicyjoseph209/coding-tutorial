#Value windows function allows you to perform calculations on a specific subset of rows in a result set

#FIRST_VALUE(): This Windows function returns the value of the specified expression with respect to the FIRST row in the Windows frame

#Syntax
select col1, col2
FIRST_VALUE(col|Expression) over ([partition], [order])
from table_name;

#LAST_VALUE(): This Windows function returns the value of the specified expression with respect to the LAST row in the Windows frame
#By default it has a range of UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT, So in order to get the desired result, we have to modify the range

#Syntax
select col1, col2
LAST_VALUE(col|Expression) over ([partition], [order])
from table_name;
